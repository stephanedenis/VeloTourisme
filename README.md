# VeloTourisme

Use a training cycle to navigate in Google Street View. 

Connect to the PC/Mac by USB. Seen as a keaboard device. Pushing on the buttons on the handles turn the image to navigate/look on right/left. Spin the cycle to move forward.

Requires an Arduino micro pro (ATMega32U4), two switches for the handles and a training cycle with a counting probe/switch.
